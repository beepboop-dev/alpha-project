**Title:** I built a free tool to help small businesses get more Google reviews (smart routing so bad reviews stay private)

**Body:**
Hey everyone — I'm a solo dev who built ReviewFlow after watching my friend's restaurant get destroyed by a 1-star review from someone who was having a bad day.

The idea is simple: instead of sending ALL customers to Google Reviews, you send them through a quick "How was your experience?" page first.

- Happy customers (4-5 stars) → redirected to leave a Google Review
- Unhappy customers (1-3 stars) → submit private feedback to you directly

This way you catch problems before they become public 1-star reviews, AND you make it super easy for happy customers to leave reviews.

**What you get (free plan):**
- Custom review page for your business
- QR code to print and put at checkout/tables
- Smart review routing
- Basic analytics

It's at https://alpha.abapture.ai — takes about 2 minutes to set up.

Would love feedback from actual business owners. What would make this more useful for you?

**Title:** From idea to live SaaS in 2 days — built a Google review management tool for local businesses

**Body:**
Built ReviewFlow — a smart review routing tool for local businesses.

The problem: Asking customers for Google reviews is risky. Happy customers forget, unhappy ones remember.

The solution: A branded review page (with QR code) that asks customers to rate their experience first. 4-5 stars → Google Reviews. 1-3 stars → private feedback.

Free tier includes everything a single-location business needs. Paid plans ($29/mo) add SMS/email templates, advanced analytics, and multi-location support.

Biggest lesson: I spent too long on features before getting it in front of real users. Now I'm here. Roast away 🙏

## Post 4: r/LocalSEO
**Title:** Free tool to route customer reviews — happy to Google, unhappy to private feedback

**Body:**
Built this for a friend's dental practice and figured others might find it useful.

ReviewFlow gives you a branded review page + QR code. When customers scan it:
- They rate their experience (1-5 stars)
- 4-5 stars → redirected to your Google Business Profile to leave a review
- 1-3 stars → they submit feedback privately to you

It's basically a review gate/funnel. Free plan covers 1 location with QR code and analytics.
