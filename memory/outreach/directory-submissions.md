**Description (long):** ReviewFlow is a smart review management tool for local businesses. Instead of hoping for 5-star reviews, ReviewFlow gives you a branded review page and QR code. When customers visit, they rate their experience first. Happy customers (4-5 stars) are redirected to leave a Google Review. Unhappy customers (1-3 stars) submit private feedback directly to you — so you can fix problems before they become public bad reviews. Free plan includes 1 location, QR code, smart review gate, and basic analytics.
