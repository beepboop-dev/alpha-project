Happy customers are guided to Google, while unhappy customers are given a private feedback form.</p><h2>How ReviewFlow Works</h2><p>ReviewFlow uses a simple star-rating gate. Customers who rate 4-5 stars are directed to your Google review page. Those who rate 1-3 stars are shown a private feedback form so you can address their concerns directly.</p><h2>Is it Ethical?</h2><p>Yes, when done right. ReviewFlow never prevents anyone from leaving a Google review — it simply routes the experience. All customers can still find and review your business on Google directly.</p>"
